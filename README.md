A python based diagnostics toolset developed for the efficient analysis of high resolution simulations of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) utilising cloud-ready datasets from the Pangeo repository.

The following are included:
- Python environment file containing all relevant packages
- Python script to combine monthly Netcdf observational data
- Metric calculation notebooks
  - Individual models
  - Defined list of models
- Metric plotting notebooka
  - A individual model
  - Individual plots for all models in a defined list
  - Cumulative plot of all each metric for all models
  - Metric variations for each model in a dedicated plot
